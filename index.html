	Development of CSS
	</h1>
		<p>
		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that uses markup language to describe the look of a document.
		</p>
		<p>
		Since the start of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), style sheets have been around in one form or another. Many were interested in improving the capabilities of web presentation, and thus nine different style sheet languages were proposed. Of the nine, Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal were especially influential on the development of CSS
		</p>
		<p>
		The development of CSS started in 1994, as the web became a platform for electronic publishing in need of a way to style documents. Since 1990, when HTML was first introduced, separating the structure of a document from its layout had always been a goal. CSS took into account the design wishes of the author, reader, and the capabilities of the display devices as well as the browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		CSS was completed in 1996 by Håkon Wium Lie, Bert Bos, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), increasing the sophisticated presentation and accessibility of websites. Some browsers supported parts of CSS-1 in 1997, but standard CSS did not become fully usable until 2001.

	<h1>
	CSS Levels
	</h1>
		<p>
		There are various levels of CSS, each building upon the last.
		</p>
		<h2>
		CSS 1
		</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
					<li>
					Color of text, background, and other elements
					<li>
					Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
					<li>
					Alignment of text, images, tables, and other elements
					<li>
					Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
				</ul>
			</p>
		<h2>
		CSS 2
		</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements
					<li>
					Concept of media types
					<li>
					Support for aural style sheets
					<li>
					New font properties
				</ul>
			</p>
		<h2>
		CSS 2.1
		</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Fixes errors in CSS 2
					<li>Removes poorly supported featuress and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specifications
				</ul>
			</p>
		<h2>
		CSS 3
		</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Divided into modules, each adding new or extending features defined in CSS 2
				</ul>
			</p>
		<h2>
		CSS 4
		</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Split into modules
				</ul>
			</p>
	<h1>
	CSS Frameworks
	</h1>
		<p>
		CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries with standard styling of web pages using CSS language and include:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Foundation,
				<li>
				Blueprint,
				<li>
				Boostrap, and
				<li>
				Cascade Framework and Materialize
			</ul>
		CSS frameworks provide ready-made options that can be used for designing an dlaying out a webpage. The frameworks are usually external style sheets that are referenced in head element of HTML. Most web authors use frameworks to prototype or learn from; they prefer to develop CSS for their own websites so they don’t have unused features in their styling.
		</p>
	<h1>
	Browser Compatibility
	</h1>
		<p>
		The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996, the same year that Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) 3 was released which featured some limited support for CSS. The first browser to fully support CSS 1 was IE 5.0, followed by many others, some of which implement parts of CSS 2.
		</p>
	<h1>
	Box Model
	</h1>
		<p>
		The box model defines how a box and its attributes relate to one another. There are four distinct parts to the box model: margin, border, padding, and content area. When you use CSS to define the width and height of your box, you are only defining the content area itself.
